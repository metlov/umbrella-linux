These are for local overlay over the Umbrella configuration repository.
The directories here are not scanned by Bcfg2 server, only a specific
files are looked for and included at specific points into the main
configuration. Thus, one can not create an arbitrary bundles into the
Bundler directory here or include an arbitrarily named rules file into
the Rules directory. You can roughly get a list of what is included by
scanning the main Umbrella repository for the "xi:include" directive.

The configuration files, placed in the Cfg directory will appear under
the path prefixed by "/local". That is, to install a local configuration
file "/etc/myconf.cfg" in the local bundle one may use the directive
<Path name="/etc/myconf.cfg" altsrc="/local/etc/myconf.cfg"> assuming
the file "myconf.cfg" (as well as corresponding info.xml) is placed 
in the Cfg/etc/myconf.cfg relatively to the Local configuration 
directory (where this file is). Genshi templating can be used within
the local configuration files and the template code has full access to
all Umbrella Linux parameters and modules.

Despite the restrictions, the overlay gives a useful possibility to amend
the standard Umbrella Linux with locally-managed software and configuration.

Please also note that the software installed via this mechanism is not
supported by Umbrella Linux neither the software itself, nor its interaction
with the standard software configured in Umbrella Linux. Use this mechanism
of amending configuration on your own risk and at your own responsibility.

The main reason for creating this overlay mechanism is not to permit an
ever diverging set of software and configurations, but use it as a local
staging area for testing the configuration options and templates before
they are submitted for inclusion into the main Umbrella configuration
repository.
