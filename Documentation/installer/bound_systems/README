This folder contains an example configuration for two coupled Umbrella Linux
systems. They can be deployed in virtualbox using the Installer script from
the parent directory (but with the configuration files from one of the
subdirectories: main or sub).

These systems trust each other (by trusting each other's certificate),
mirror each-other's DNS and allow cross-domain Jabber connections. The
"main" system, additionally, has VPN configured allowing to deploy roaming
workstations.

Because the trust is designated by including the trusted system's certificate
in firewall.xml file, both these examples come with pre-generated
umbrella_keys.xml files. If you want to generate your own passwords -- omit
the umbrella_keys.xml when running the installer, but update the firewall.xml
file of another system once the umbrella_keys.xml (and the certificate,
contained within) is generated.
