Umbrella Linux is a collaboration platform for system's administrators
to work on a complex and full-featured IT infrastructure of an organization 
(big or small).

At the moment, Umbrella Linux installs and maintains a customizable Unix
systems cluster (including both servers and workstations) with 
[LDAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol)-based
centralized users and workstation management, 
[Kerberos](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/)-based single sign on,
[NFSv4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System) shared filesystem,
DNS zone management, organization's web server,
external and internal E-mail services (including, optionally configured 
Webmail interface), Jabber-based intra-organization conferencing, 
[X2Go](https://wiki.x2go.org/)-based
terminal service for local underpowered machines and for remote graphical
access to the system, user's workstations can be (re)deployed automatically
by booting from the network.

The security and monitoring features include the external firewall and DMZ
for the externally-accessible services (except for the SSH protocol), 
[Nagios](https://www.nagios.org/)
for checking the services status, [OSSEC](https://ossec.github.io/)
 for log analysis and active response
to known threats, and, of course, the non-stop control of the confuguration
of all the servers and workstations using [BCFG2](http://bcfg2.org/).

These are just the major features, much more is inside.
