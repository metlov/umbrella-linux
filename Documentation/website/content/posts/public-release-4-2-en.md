I'm happy to announce the version 0.4.2 of the Umbrella Linux.

At the time of the present COVID-19 pandemic, the main focus of this quick
release is integration of the Apache OpenMeetings to enable remote
videoconferencing.

### Summary of Changes:

* Apache OpenMeetings 5.0.0-M3 integration.
* Some OSSEC spam clean up.
* Minor bugfixes.
