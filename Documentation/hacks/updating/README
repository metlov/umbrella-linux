These scripts can be used to update all the core Umbrella Linux server VMs
in an LXD environment. They should be run as root from the LXD VM host.

The ./refresh_all_servers script updates the bcgf2 status of all servers in
bcfg2 reports database, which can be checked via the web interface. The
./update_all_servers script then can be used to apply the updates.
