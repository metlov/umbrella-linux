To enable local package repositories do the following:

1. create the file
   Cfg/etc/apt/sources.list.d/localrepo.list/localrepo.list.G50_base
   with the apt configuration directives.

2. create the binary file
   Cfg/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/localrepo.gpg/localrepo.gpg.G50_base
   with GPG keyring containing the public keys to local repositories.

3. create the file
   Packages/sources-local.xml
   with the definition of package sources in xml for Packages plugin.

These three files will not be tracked by git.
