Description
===========
This is a Squirrelmail plugin to change password using the Poppassd service

You can get poppassd compliant services from the following places:
Pawel Krawczyk      http://ipsec.pl/meta/pawel-krawczyk-projekty-open-source.html (Supports PAM)
Andrew Stevenson    ftp://ftp.ugh.net.au/pub/unix/poppwd
NetWin              http://netwinsite.com/poppassd/      (Changes /etc/passwd)
Kerberos            http://kpoppassd.sourceforge.net (Thank to Michael G. Rozman this link)
HP-UX 11.x          http://barney.gonzaga.edu/~awithers/poppassd/ (link from above site)
BSD users should try the one from the ports collection for their brand of BSD first.
Courier users should try courierpassd at http://www.arda.homeunix.net/store/

poppassd must be running on your whatever server handles the passwords for your
mail server for this plugin to work.  Other than that, you just need to add
this plugin to SquirrelMail (using the perl script or by editing config.php
by hand), and all should be fine. For full installation instructions,
see the INSTALL file.

To change the server or port poppassd listens on, see the INSTALL file.

If you experience problems, please see the INSTALL file and FAQ
