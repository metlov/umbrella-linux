Installing change_pass
======================
0) NOTE: This plugin is not needed for SquirrelMail 1.5.0 or above.
   The functionality it provides is already included in the
   change_password plugin that is part of 1.5.x.

   This plugin requires SquirrelMail 1.4.20 or later (or 1.4.0+ and
   Compatibility 2.0.16).

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
   Here is an example for the 3.1 version of the change_pass plugin.

  $ cd plugins
  $ tar -zxf change_pass-3.1-1.4.0.tar.gz

2) By default, the plugin will connect to the IMAP server configured
   for SquirrelMail on port 106 to change passwords.
   If you need to change any of the following:
     IP address of your poppass server
     poppass server port number (if not 106)
     minimum or maximum password length
   you will need to create a configuration file.

   Decide if you want to store the plugin configuration file
   in the plugin directory or in the main SquirrelMail config
   directory.

   A) To store the configuration file in the plugin directory,
      change into the change_pass directory, copy config_example.php
      to config.php and edit config.php, making adjustments as
      you deem necessary.

     $ cd change_pass
     $ cp config_example.php config.php
     $ vi config.php

   B) To store the configuration file in the main SquirrelMail
      config directory, change into the change_pass directory,
      copy config_example.php to ../../config/config_change_pass.php
      and edit ../../config/config_change_pass.php, making
      adjustments as you deem necessary.

     $ cd change_pass
     $ cp config_example.php ../../config/config_change_pass.php
     $ vi ../../config/config_change_pass.php

3) Go to your config directory and run conf.pl.  Choose
   option 8 and move the plugin from the "Available Plugins"
   category to the "Installed Plugins" category.  Save and
   exit.

  $ cd ../../../../config/
  $ ./conf.pl
