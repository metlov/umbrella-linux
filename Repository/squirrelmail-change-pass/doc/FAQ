Q. I get an error saying "ERROR: Connection refused (111)"

A. You don't have a poppass daemon running on the server you've selected.
   Make certain you have followed the installation steps in the INSTALL
   document and tested it as shown below.

Q. The plugin does not seem to work

A. Make sure you can change the password manually.
   To test, try telneting into the daemon and changing a password:

    $ telnet localhost 106
    Trying 127.0.0.1...
    Connected to localhost.
    Escape character is '^]'.
    200 poppassd v1.8.1 hello, who are you?
    user <username>
    200 Your password please.
    pass <oldpassword>
    200 Your new password please.
    newpass <newpassword>
    200 Password changed, thank-you.
    quit
    200 Bye.
    Connection closed by foreign host.
