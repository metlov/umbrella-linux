This directory contains the sources of some Umbrella-specific packages.

The binary versions of these packages are distributed via the official Umbrella
Linux repository, while the sources live here. This directory is not part of
the configuration, just ignore it if you do not plan to contribute to the
packages. In any case you should not build these packages on a configuration
server. Just check out this repository to another place, which has all the
necessary build dependencies.

Just as a reminder a package can be built by executing:
 dpkg-buildpackage -b -tc -uc
in its source directory.

Umbrella Linux (c) 2015-2017 Konstantin L. Metlov <metlov@donfti.ru>
