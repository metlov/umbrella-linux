Installing Plugin
=================
Simply untar the file in the plugins directory, and make sure it is
in its own directory, and that the name of the directory is the name
of the plugin:

    $ cd /var/www/squirrelmail/plugins
    $ tar -xzvf /home/archives/folder_sizes-1.5-1.4.0.tar.gz

Then go to your config directory and run conf.pl.  Choose option
8 and add the plugin (+).  Save and exit, then that should be all
if the plugin was made correctly.  :)

  $ cd ../config
  $ ./conf.pl

Plugin adds own option block to SquirrelMail Folder Options page. 
"Folder Sizes" link is enabled by default in folder listing.

Plugin translations use folder_sizes domain. folder_sizes.po and 
folder_sizes.mo files should be  stored in same directory that 
stores squirrelmail.po and squirrelmail.mo files. Translations 
are maintained by SquirrelMail Internationalization Team and are 
distributed in SquirrelMail locale packages.
