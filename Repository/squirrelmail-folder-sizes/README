folder_sizes -- Version 1.5

Description
===========
Shows a the list of folders in the same order (should be!) as the default left
hand frame. Included are message count, unread count and total message size
for each folder so you can tell where all your storage has gone.

The details are shown either buy clicking a link that appears under the
folder list (left frame), or when the 'On Folders page' option is selected,
they appear after 'Subscribe/Unsubscribe' box on the 'Folders' page.

Optionally (not by default though) shows totals for each sub-folder in a
mailbox.

Requirements
============
This plugin version requires SquirrelMail 1.4.0 or later version. For good
internationalization support PHP 4.2+ with gettext extension is recommended.
If gettext extension is not available, use of SquirrelMail 1.5.1+ is 
recommended.


Usage
=====
There are four options that are listed on the 'Folder Preferences' page.
One is to place a link on the left hand frame, under the standard folder
list, that when clicked displays your folder usage in the right frame. The
default perference is to show this link.

The next option controls style of "Folder Sizes" text in left_main.php 
folder listing. It can be link or button.

The third option is to include the folder size list on the 'Folders' page. I
orignially had the list on the bottom of the 'Folders' page - but then
realised that if you had a lot of folders, and wanted to add more this would
be a real pain in the butt if your system was slowed down.

The fourth option determines whether totals for each sub-folder are shown.

If site admin wants to reduce number of options available to end users, 
individual options can be enforced and removed in forced_prefs plugin.


To Do
=====

1. Suggestions welcome.

Changes
=======

v0.1     1-Apr-2002     Initial version
v0.2     2-Apr-2002     Handles hierarchies (folders hold messages or
                        other folders - not both).
v0.3     7-Apr-2002	Parent folders are determined better with the
                        'noinferiours' flag. Uses blank column for
			indentation and include </TR> and </TD> for
			browsers that can't understand stuff without them.
			Added subtotals as an option. Added Unread count.
v0.4     8-Apr-2002     Correctly shows folders that may contain both children
                        and messages by using 'noselect' flag to exclude
			counts, not 'noinferiours' as before.
v1.0	27-Apr-2002	Fixed missing </TD> in header. As there are several
			hundred downloads and only this one error reported I
			think we can call this version 1.0 now.
v1.1	17-Oct-2002	Works with register_gloabls on or off. Incorporated
			Frode Nordahl's il8n support.
v1.2	 9-Feb-2003	Works with Squirrelmail 1.4. Uses unformatted-disp
			folder names so when all folders are under INBOX
			things look nicer. Introduced option of having link
			as a button instead of text.
v1.3	13-Mar-2003	Solves small problem with config include conflicting
			with some other plugins by using SM_PATH.
v1.4	 7-Apr-2003	Works with official 1.4 release. Fetches messages in
			batches to avoid PHP memory size problems. Also hoped
			this fixes performance problems on some servers (UW).
v1.5rc1 2006-05-01
    - Changes in plugin maintainer. Plugin is maintained by SM-Plugins project

    - Added GPL license file.
