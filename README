This is the source code of an Umbrella Linux metadistribution and its
configuration repository.

The Umbrella Linux is a scripted configuration for a cluster of Unix
servers and workstations. It is a metadistribution in a sense that the
Linux packages themselves, which are managed by Umbrella, come from
other Linux distributions (most notably from Ubuntu). Under Umbrella
these packages are used to create an integrated globally parametrized
system of virtual servers and services. This system can be deployed on
a single Umnbrella-managed physical server as a set of KVM/QEMU virtial
machines, onto a third party virtualization platform or even into a single
virtial machine as a set of Umbrella-managed LXD containers. Deployed
Umbrella system can be used as a source for further automated network
deployment of workstations and servers, creating a centrally-managed
complete computing and office environment for an organization.

At the heart of the Umbrella is the BCFG2 configuration management system,
developed at Argonne National Laboratory. The Umbrella Linux itself is
mainly a set of configuration files and scripts.
