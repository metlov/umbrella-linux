This is the source code of an Umbrella Linux Metadistribution and its
configuration repository.

The Umbrella Linux is a metadistribution for a cluster of Unix servers and
workstations. It is a metadistribution, since the Linux packages themselves,
which are used by Umbrella come from other Linux distributions (mostly from
Ubuntu). The Umbrella Linux is a systems integration project for these
packages, which organizes them into a coherent globally parametrized
system of virtual servers and services. It allows to deploy on a couple
of physical servers and a pile of network-installable workstations
a complete computing and office environment for an organization.

At the heart of the Umbrella is the BCFG2 configuration management system,
developed by Argonne National Laboratory. The Umbrella Linux itself is
mainly a set of configuration files and scripts.
